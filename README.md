Description of the example graph for homework assignment week 7:
In this graph I have plotted the top 5 songs of of different bachelors (list will become a lot bigger once I have gathered more data). I am not sure yet which aspects of the songs I want to compare, for now I have chosen energy and valence. I think that I will eventually will compare genre (if possible) and valence for each bachelor. I have put out multiple ways to gather data (google forms and canvas discussions). 

The plot shows 5 songs per bachelor, bachelor type is marked by colour, size is linked to loudness and the Y-axis show energy and X-axis valence.
